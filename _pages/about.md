I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/mathematics/). I am studying on [homotopy type theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+type+theory), and my current advisors are [Prof. Aaron Lauda](https://sites.google.com/view/lauda-home/home) and [Assoc. Prof. Michael Shulman](https://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/). My research interests also include mathematical logic, category theory, and combinatorics. Currently, I am partially supported by NSF grant DMS-1902092, the Army Research Office
W911NF-20-1-0075, and Simons Foundation.  

I earned my M.Sc. degree from [Koç University](https://science.ku.edu.tr/en/departments/mathematics/about/) in 2019, with the thesis "[LDPC codes from partially balanced incomplete block designs](https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/TezGoster?key=npGs9H39x7G6401x51yqpNXM5uk3K2hJLEjxTCkRKdmxpBXGIA-yZyLf6Ca4yhy6)", under the supervision of [Prof. Emine Şule Yazıcı](http://home.ku.edu.tr/~eyazici/). I earned my B.Sc. degree from [Bilgi University](https://www.bilgi.edu.tr/en/academic/faculty-of-engineering-and-natural-sciences/mathematics/) in 2017 with the project "The Game Of Hex & The Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem", under the supervision of [Kemal Ilgar Eroğlu](https://www.bilgi.edu.tr/en/academic/staff/kemal-ilgar-eroglu/).
