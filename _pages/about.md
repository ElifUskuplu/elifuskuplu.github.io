I am a [Zorn's Postdoctoral Fellow](https://math.indiana.edu/about/zorn-postdoctoral-archive.html) at Indiana University, Bloomington, starting in August 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Larry Moss](https://iulg.sitehost.iu.edu/moss/). I was a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/mathematics/) in the Spring 24 semester. 

I received my Ph.D from USC with the thesis named _Formalizing two-level type theory with cofibrant exo-nat_. I am studying on [homotopy type theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+type+theory), and my thesis advisors are [Prof. Aaron Lauda](https://sites.google.com/view/lauda-home/home) and [Assoc. Prof. Michael Shulman](https://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/). Recently, I have been awarded the Edward and Dolores Blum Research prize by the USC Graduate Committee.

My research interests span the areas of logic, foundations of mathematics, category theory, type theory, and computer science. My secondary research interests include combinatorial design theory and coding theory.

I earned my M.Sc. degree from [Koç University](https://science.ku.edu.tr/en/departments/mathematics/about/) in 2019, with the thesis "[LDPC codes from partially balanced incomplete block designs](https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/TezGoster?key=npGs9H39x7G6401x51yqpNXM5uk3K2hJLEjxTCkRKdmxpBXGIA-yZyLf6Ca4yhy6)", under the supervision of [Prof. Emine Şule Yazıcı](https://mysite.ku.edu.tr/eyazici/). I earned my B.Sc. degree from [Bilgi University](https://www.bilgi.edu.tr/en/academic/faculty-of-engineering-and-natural-sciences/mathematics/) in 2017 with the project "The Game Of Hex & The Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem", under the supervision of [Kemal Ilgar Eroğlu](https://www.bilgi.edu.tr/en/academic/staff/kemal-ilgar-eroglu/).
